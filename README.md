# Global Organizations Data Analysis Project

### Overview
This project was developed as part of the CITS1401 (Computational Thinking with Python) unit at UWA. The goal of the project was to analyze organizational data on a global scale, including variables such as employee count, median salary, and profitability across multiple countries. The project aimed to provide insights into the distribution of organizational resources and their financial health across different regions.

### Project Objective
The primary objectives of this project were:
1. To analyze the relationship between the number of employees and profitability in global organizations.
2. To identify trends in median salaries across different countries.
3. To develop a Python-based solution to process and visualize data without relying on external libraries, focusing on built-in Python functions for efficiency.

### Technology Stack
- Programming Language: Python
- Tools Used: 
  - Built-in Python libraries (no external libraries like pandas or numpy were used)
  - CSV files for data input
  - Basic data manipulation techniques (loops, conditionals, and string manipulation)

### Key Features
- Data Processing: Developed custom Python functions to read, clean, and manipulate large CSV datasets.
- Data Analysis: Conducted in-depth analysis of employee count, median salary, and profitability metrics for organizations across different countries.
- Performance Optimization: Focused on processing large datasets without using external libraries, improving computational efficiency through built-in Python functions.

### Project Status
- Completed: 
  - Successfully developed Python code to analyze organizational data.
  - Processed data for several global organizations, extracting data insights related to their profitability, employee count, and salary structure.
